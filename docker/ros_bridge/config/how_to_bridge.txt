In order for it all to work, you need 4 terminals:
    1. ros_bridge docker running rosbridge with 
        ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge --bridge-all-topics
    2. ros1 docker running roscore
        roscore
    3. ros2 container running whatever nodes and stuff
    4. ros1 container running whatever nodes and stuff

source install/setup.bash
ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge --bridge-all-topics
