In order for it all to work, you need 4 terminals:
    1. ros_bridge docker running rosbridge with 
        ros2 run ros1_bridge dynamic_bridge
    2. ros1 docker running roscore
        roscore
    3. ros2 container running whatever nodes and stuff
    4. ros1 container running whatever nodes and stuff

Terminals 1 and 2 are for the bridge, 3 and 4 are for your application.

To fake a subscriber for a topic that originates from ROS 1, 
ros2 topic echo <topic-name> <topic-type>
