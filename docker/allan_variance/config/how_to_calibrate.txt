place your imu down and record data for like 3 ish hours (hella long but make sure to only record the imu or else your storage is gonna boom)

cook (filter) the rosbag with
rosrun allan_variance_ros cookbag.py --input original.bag --output cooked.bag

run the calibration
rosrun allan_variance_ros allan_variance [path_to_folder_containing_bag] [path_to_config_file]

make sure theres only one bag in the folder and also make sure youre like not inside of the folder of the bag itself
rosrun allan_variance_ros allan_variance config config/oakd_imu.yaml

then analyze it with:
rosrun allan_variance_ros analysis.py --data allan_variance.csv --config config/realsense_d425i.yaml

this will give you the actual imu.yaml with all of the allan variance parameters. 
If it gives error like Infinity or NaN, then something is wrong
with the data, usually it's cuz your bag is too short
