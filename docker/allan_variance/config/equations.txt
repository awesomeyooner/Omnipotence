========Noise density to covariances========

covariance = (noise density)^2 * sample rate

(for oak d the measurements are sampled at 400hz, so sample rate = 400)

this works for both accel and gyro

so 

accel cov = (accel noise density)^2 * sample rate

gyro cov = (gyro noise density)^2 * sample rate


==========Random Walk to Process Noise (random walk is like drift)=======

process noise = (random walk)^2

since we only know random walk for gyro and accel, that means we can only get the process noise for 
vroll, vpitch, vyaw, and ax, ay, az 

==========Noise Density to Process Noise========

process noise = (noise density)^2

we know noise density for both accel and gyro, but these are for each  of the integrals, so velocity for accel and orientation for gyro.
roll, pitch, yaw and vx, vy, vz



======SUMMARY======

Accel Covariance = (accel noise density)^2 * sample rate
Gyro Covariance = (gyro noise density)^2 * sample rate

Accel Process Noise = (accel random walk)^2
Gyro Process Noise = (gyro random walk)^2

Linear Velocity Process Noise = (accel noise density)^2
Orientation Process Noise = (gyro noise density)^2

Linear Position Process Noise is hard to find, so just tune it manually (use like 0.03, between 0.01 and 0.05)
